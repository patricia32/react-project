# React Frontend Project

## Description
This is a frontend project built with React and TypeScript. It displays a list of products with images and reviews. The project uses ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript in strict mode to ensure safe and consistent coding practices. The application is designed to be maintainable, following best practices for React development.

---

## Technologies Used
React 18+, TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Material-UI (Rating component), Vite (or Create React App, depending on setup), and a mock API for products.

---

## Setup
Clone the repository, install dependencies with `npm install`, and run the application locally using `npm run dev` (or `npm start` if using Create React App). Open the application in your browser at `http://localhost:5173` (port may vary depending on your setup).

---

## ESLint & Prettier
The code is automatically formatted on save if Prettier is configured in VS Code. ESLint can be run manually using `npm run lint`. The project is set up with TypeScript strict mode and ESLint rules to catch common mistakes and enforce best practices.
